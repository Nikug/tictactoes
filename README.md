## How to run

This project uses Node v18 and modern [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). To get started:

- Clone this repository
- Navigate to the project root
- Run `yarn` to install dependencies
- Run `yarn dev` to start the project in development mode

## Editor tooling

Modern Yarn doesn't use `node_modules` so you might need to run a script to generate necessary files for your editor. More information [here](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/editor-sdks)
